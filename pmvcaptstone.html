<p>Bella Bella is located on the <strong>central coast </strong> of British Columbia, Canada. It is the traditional unceded homelands of the <em>Heiltsuk</em> First Nation. The Heiltsuk have resided in their homelands for 14,000 years. The current townsite was built in 1897 and was completed in 1900. The Old town is located 3 km south of the current site. The decsion to move was lack of land and a devastating small pox epidemic. Hudson's Bay built Fort Mclaughlin at Old Town but was eventually abandoned in favor of mobile steamship trading. The Heiltsuk are very adaptive and quickly adopted European styled housing over traditional First Nation "big houses". The housing was purchased or traded with the Hudson's Bay company. These houses even had servant's quarters and hidden stairwells leading from the servants room's directly to the kitchen. These stairwells ran between the walls. Some of these houses still exist today.

  Heiltsuk territory stretches over 16,000 sq kms and is situated in the Great Bear Rainforest. Because the Heiltsuk territory is so isolated from many urban centres the territory was largely untouched. Today large scale industrial logging, fishing, shellfish harvesting, as well as tourism is the main employers in the region. There is a fish plant, airport, ferry terminal, government dock, 2 denominal Churches, band store, liquor store, post office, 3 schools & a college, & a fuel station. All entities are operated under the Heiltsuk Tribal Council (except the 2 churches) and provide employment opportunities.
</p>
<p> Recent developments include an extended airport runway, new BC Ferries terminal, new Band Store (old one burned down in 2013), and a new Big House with a completion date in fall 2019. Other recent projects include a commmunity garden and a boardwalk trail. </p>

<p> Bella Bella has signifigant fisheries opportunities, shell fish harvesting, and Row on Kelp fisheries. There was a large spill in 2016 and this spill removed $200,000 from the local economy in shellfish harvsting. The Heiltsuk Nation is strongly against any oil pipe developments anywhere on the BC coast. <img src="images/nathanstewart.jpg">
