<p>Bella Bella is located on the <strong>central coast </strong> of British Columbia, Canada. It is the traditional unceded homelands of the <em>Heiltsuk</em> First Nation. The Heiltsuk have resided in their homelands for 14,000 years. The current townsite was built in 1897 and was completed in 1900. The Old town is located 3 km south of the current site. The decsion to move was lack of land and a devastating small pox epidemic. Hudson's Bay built Fort Mclaughlin at Old Town but was eventually abandoned in favor of mobile steamship trading. The Heiltsuk are very adaptive and quickly adopted European styled housing over traditional First Nation "big houses". The housing was purchased or traded with the Hudson's Bay company. These houses even had servant's quarters and hidden stairwells leading from the servants room's directly to the kitchen. These stairwells ran between the walls. Some of these houses still exist today.
